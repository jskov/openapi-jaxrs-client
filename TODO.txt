# Model cleanup
* TypeLocalTime and TypeDateTime should be passive carriers of the type.
  Let the generator handle the java-specific implementations (make the model simpler, and more generic).

# Others

o Make options self-documenting
o Generator option to use primitive types for non-optional fields
o Generator flag to select primitives/wrappers in API parameters
o Responses @APIResponse are not handling Maps correctly. Need an example to work from.
o Handle form parameters. See disabled tests params/form/* and examples/azure
