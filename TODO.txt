# Model cleanup
* TypeLocalTime and TypeDateTime should be passive carriers of the type.
  Let the generator handle the java-specific implementations (make the model simpler, and more generic).

# v31
API:
  * .../map
    does not handle object inner types because of createSupplementalValidation
  * still a lot of instanceof in the TypeConverter so the "all" document used in the specs
    tests must be woefully incomplete

# Others

o Make options self-documenting
o Generator option to use primitive types for non-optional fields
o Generator flag to select primitives/wrappers in API parameters
o Responses @APIResponse are not handling Maps correctly. Need an example to work from.
o Handle form parameters. See disabled tests params/form/* and examples/azure

# Eclipse
* Gradle 9.1.0/eclipse runs differently now, confusing mustache
  mkdir -f -p modules/generator/bin/eclipseApt
  cd modules/generator/bin/eclipseApt
  ln -s ../../src/main/resources/templates .
