Added manual test input to add new variance (from kundedata)

The added OpenApi code does not look like that generated by Java OpenApi
(the upper part).

But it does look valid and sensible; the subtypes relies on declarations on
the super type to be inherited (where as the java OpenApi output are duplicated).

I have added two sub-class variants, one (a) overrides one of the fields
of the super. The other (b) does not.
