Test that fields can be placed in OpenApi-document order.

Since the json schema spec does not care about ordering, this is just
a haphazard bet on the OpenApi document keeping the same intended
ordering over time. Which it may well do. Or not.

Relevant spec section: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00#section-4.2.2
