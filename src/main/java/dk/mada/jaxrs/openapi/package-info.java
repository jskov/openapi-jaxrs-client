/**
 * Transforms OpenApi schema-based model to the
 * internal model.
 *
 * This is the only package that should work with OpenApi
 * types.
 *
 * Steps in converting the OpenApi document into the
 * internal model:
 *
 * - Use OpenAPIParser to parse the document
 * - Convert the OpenApi data to model types.
 *   All type references are made with ParserTypeRef
 *   since there may be references to types not
 *   yet encountered.
 * - Find and resolve name conflicts.
 *   This causes all affected TypeName references
 *   to be updated.
 * - Finally replace all ParserTypeRefs with
 *   model's TypeRefs and parser DTO instances
 *   with (possibly renamed) model DTO instances.
 *
 * The model is now self-contained and immutable,
 * ready to be used by the generators.
