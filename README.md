### Community Collaboration

I like Open Source just as much as the next guy.

This tool provides infrastructure to whomever uses it, so it should be Open Source.

And it is; the main body of code is covered by the [European Union Public Licence](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12).  
Except for the [templates](./modules/generator/src/main/resources/templates) and the single class [OpenapiStringUtils](modules/generator/src/main/java/dk/mada/jaxrs/generator/mpclient/dto/OpenapiStringUtils.java), which are covered by the [Apache License](./LICENSE-apache).

But (my definition of) stability and quality of the generator's output is more important to me than being able to accept changes from other parties.  
It is a tool I rely on to provide a difference for colleagues at work.

So while you are welcome to access and fork the source code, I am not as such interested in contributions.  
Unless they just happen to align with my interests, of course.

If you are itching to make some changes, please open an issue first, so we can discuss.  
I do not want you to waste your time!

I welcome bug reports if you use the generator and experience problems.

## Consultancy

The project is Open Source and I am happy for you to use the generator, report bugs and suggest changes.

But while the source code is free, it does not come bundled with promises or guarantees of free work.

I will try to fix reported bugs, but will commit to no time tables.

However, I am willing to implement feature requests as a paid service (1,200DKK/hour) assuming:

* I agree with the suggested feature
* Approval from my employer to work for you (not expected to be a problem, as the context will be this project)
* I have not reached my limit of hours (40 hours - Danish VAT limit is 50,000DKK/running-12-months)

Please reach out to me via email if you would like to make use of this offer.

If the above requirements are not agreeable, you are more than welcome to fork the project and do your own thing.
